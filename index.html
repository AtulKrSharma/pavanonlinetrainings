							<p class="description">I recently completed an online SDET training course with Pavan. Initially I had several apprehensions about how an online training would work for me and also about the quality and pace of the training and trainer support. These were all put to ease when I attended the first demo session. This was truly the best training I have come across. The course was very well structured with extremely comprehensive training resources. Pavan ensured the course was properly paced, giving me plenty of time to understand and absorb the content and would promptly respond to any queries I had. He is not only an expert in his field but is also very passionate about providing the best level of training to his students. I would highly recommend him and this training to anyone who wants to expand their testing skills and improve their employability to excel in the current competitive software testing market.</p>

							<p class="description">I was hesitant to take up an online automation course at first, but now I love it. All thanks to Pavan! Pavan teaches with lots of patience and commitment and is very responsive to emails as well. The course not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. I enjoyed being able to learn from Pavan, and the fact that it's online, giving me lifetime access to the course material. He is an amazing teacher, very kind and helpful, and extremely punctual with his timings. Because of his friendly nature even small and silly doubts can be clarified without any hesitation. After completion of the course, I was also provided with all the necessary materials and useful links to be able to practice Automation and Java programming independently. I urge anyone considering Automation to join Pavan’s Online Automation Classes, even if you have no prior experience. It's an investment that pays off.</p>

But Pavan proved it wrong , I had an excellent time during the classes because all the questions were answered during the class . The content of course was framed to learn everything from basic to high level The examples used , can make anyone to remember the concepts . Pavan frequently checked assignments and gave review , which gave one motivation to work more .He could be reached anytime for any clarification . I would strongly recommend this online session and definitely with Pavan.</p>

An amazing amount of resources(website) to practice the lesson learned in the class. I went into this course with a bare understanding of Selenium and now I HAVE the knowledge, not just the web driver but a Selenium Framework.If you want to take ANY Selenium course, THIS is the course.Pavan put in an amazing amount of effort into this course. Follow along, do the work and you will be Amazing too.The depth with which Pavan has handled to teach Selenium is unmatchable!! I am really pleased with it.Definitely, in the future, I will take another course with him.</p>
